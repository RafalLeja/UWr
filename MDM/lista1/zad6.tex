    \maketitle

    Funkcje wykładniczą możemy zapisać za pomocą szeregu Maclaurena:
    \[
      e^x = \sum\limits_{i = 0}^{\infty} \frac{x^i}{i!},
    \]

    wtedy dla $ x = \frac{1}{n} $, mamy:
    \[
      e^\frac{1}{n} = 1 + \frac{1}{n} + \sum\limits_{i = 2}^{\infty} \frac{x^i}{i!}.
    \]
    
    Resztę szeregu możemy ograniczyć w następujący sposób:
    \begin{align*}
      \sum\limits_{i = 2}^{\infty} \frac{x^i}{i!} = 
      \sum\limits_{1 = 2}^{\infty} n^i i! &\leq \sum\limits_{i=2}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2 2^i} \\
      \frac{1}{n^2} \sum\limits_{i=2}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2^i} &= \frac{1}{2} \frac{1}{n^2} \text{(z szeregu geometrycznego)} \\
      \sum\limits_{i = 2}^{\infty} \frac{x^i}{i!} &= O \left( \frac{1}{n^2} \right).
    \end{align*}

    Zatem:
    \[
     e^\frac{1}{n}  = 1 + \frac{1}{n} + O \left( \frac{1}{n^2} \right).
    \]
