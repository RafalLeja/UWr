    \begin{itemize}
      \item $ 0.99 ^ n $ :
        \[
          \lim_{n \to \infty} 0.99 ^ n = 0
        \]
      \item $ \left( 1 + \frac{1}{n}\right) ^ n $ :
        \[
          \lim_{n \to \infty} \left( 1 + \frac{1}{n}\right) ^ n = e
        \]
    \end{itemize}

    Wiemy że:
    \[
      \log n \leq n \leq n \log n \leq n^2 : \forall_{n \geq 0},
    \]

    więc powyższe funkcje są w takim porządku:
\[
    0.99 ^ n, \left( 1 + \frac{1}{n}\right) ^ n, \log n , n , n \log n , n^2 
  \]

  \begin{itemize}
    \item $ \left( \log n \right) ^ n $ :

  \end{itemize}
